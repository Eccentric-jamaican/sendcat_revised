1.  **Default to Vertical Stacking:**
    * Always start with `flex flex-col` for containers.
    * Only switch to `flex-row` using responsive prefixes (e.g., `md:flex-row`) for desktop layouts.

2.  **Mobile-First Classes:**
    * NEVER write desktop styles as the default.
    * WRONG: `<div class="w-[500px]">`
    * CORRECT: `<div class="w-full max-w-md">`
    * Use standard padding: `p-4` (mobile) -> `md:p-8` (desktop).

3.  **Touch Targets (Crucial):**
    * All interactive elements (buttons, inputs, links) must be at least 44px high.
    * Use `min-h-[44px]` or `h-12` for buttons.
    * Ensure generous spacing (`gap-4` or `gap-6`) so users don't misclick.

4.  **Typography Scaling:**
    * Use readable base sizes.
    * H1: `text-3xl font-bold md:text-5xl`
    * Body: `text-base md:text-lg`
    * Avoid text that is too small (< 14px) on mobile.

5.  **Navigation:**
    * Default to a Hamburger menu/Drawer/Sheet for navigation.
    * Only show a horizontal link bar on `lg:` screens.

6.  **Images:**
    * Always include `w-full h-auto object-cover` to prevent overflow issues on small screens.

When I ask for a component, generate the Mobile view code primarily.


6. **STRICT Typography Rules (Fluid Scale):**
   * We are using a custom "Fluid Type" system in tailwind.config.
   * NEVER use: text-4xl, text-5xl, text-xl (unless for icons).
   * ALWAYS use semantic classes for text:
       - Hero/Main Title: `class="text-h1 font-bold leading-tight"`
       - Section Headers: `class="text-h2 font-semibold leading-tight"`
       - Card Titles: `class="text-h3 font-medium"`
       - Body Paragraphs: `class="text-body leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground"`
       - Captions/Meta: `class="text-sm-fluid text-muted-foreground"`

maintain mobile responsiveness by:

Using TailwindCSS utility classes for responsive design, leveraging its built-in breakpoints (e.g., sm:, md:, lg:, xl:) to adjust layouts and styles for different screen sizes.

Components and sections were structured with responsive flexbox, grid, and width classes, ensuring elements stacked, resized, or shifted correctly on mobile.

Images and assets used the object-cover and width/height constraints, so they scaled well across devices.

Often wrap key sections and UI elements inside containers with responsive padding and margin settings.

Any animated elements (handled by GSAP) were given breakpoints to control their motion or presence based on device width.

The main components are built using shadcn ui primitives if a component is not found in the ui folder install it using bun install @shadcn/ui add {component name}.
